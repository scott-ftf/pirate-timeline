### Unhappy Community

Since grewalsatinder was on holiday, he did not update the Bitcointalk forum thread with all the new updates and happenings on PIRATE project. This led to some arguments and people wanting to restart the chain. To that point, many community members had already been mining PIRATE for about a week, hence why jl777 proposed a giveaway of 250,000 PIRATE, which totaled to around 10% total circulating supply at that date/time.
