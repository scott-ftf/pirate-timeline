### dPoW

SHossain announces that "Notarization of private chain worked!", which was previously not the case (The tests were done on a seperate chain with the same params as Pirate called TXSCLPRT). The chain forks the next day and dPoW gets integrated. On top of that, the halving time increased by 5 and this change increased the total supply amount of the PIRATE blockchain to approximately 200 million.
